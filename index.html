                <h1>Big Friend ship</h1>
                <p>Friendship is a very big concept, and there are countless factors that make two people become good friends.
                     Friends are not just our classmates or people who work at the same place, but friends are people who are acquaintances and love each other.
                     A person does not have any limit in making friends, and we can always have new friends from many places.
                     Friendship does not discriminate between skin color, age or race.
                     For example, I am an Asian, and I have friends all over the world from Europe to America.
                     The importance of friendship is not the appearance, but the characteristics of that person.
                      We often make friends with people who have similar hobbies and habits like us, or with people whom we feel happy to talk with.
                       Friendship does not only exist between humans and humans, but it exists among many different animals. 
                       We always know that dog is the most loyal friend to human, and the fact that a dog knows how to love us speaks for the diversity of friendship. 
                       If we raise many animals in the same house for a long time, there is a high possibility that they will also become friends and love each other. 
                       Friendship is a great relationship that blurs many distances and creates positive things. 
                       If any of us is lucky enough to have a good friend, we should try to keep that friendship for a long time.

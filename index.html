                <h1>Environment</h1>
                <p>Environment is an essential part of our life.
                     A clean environment is necessary for a peaceful and healthy life. 
                     An environment is the natural surroundings which helps human beings, animals and other living things to grow and develop naturally. 
                     But nowadays, our environment is disturbing in many different ways. 
                     Any type of disturbance in nature's balance affects the environment totally. 
                     It does not only ruin human lives but also affects all living beings. 
                     We can save our environment with the little step taken by everyone on the earth. 
                     We should reduce the amount of waste, throwing wastes properly to its place only and many other simple ways. 
                     It is very important to save the environment for human existence. 
                     When we protect the environment, we are protecting ourselves and our future as well.</p>

                <h1>Big Friend ship</h1>
                <p>Friendship is a very big concept, and there are countless factors that make two people become good friends.
                    Friends are not just our classmates or people who work at the same place, but friends are people who are acquaintances and love each other.
                     A person does not have any limit in making friends, and we can always have new friends from many places.
                     Friendship does not discriminate between skin color, age or race.
                     For example, I am an Asian, and I have friends all over the world from Europe to America.
                     The importance of friendship is not the appearance, but the characteristics of that person. We often make friends with people who have similar hobbies and habits like us, or with people whom we feel happy to talk with. 
                     Friendship does not only exist between humans and humans, but it exists among many different animals. 
                     We always know that dog is the most loyal friend to human, and the fact that a dog knows how to love us speaks for the diversity of friendship. 
                     If we raise many animals in the same house for a long time, there is a high possibility that they will also become friends and love each other. 
                     Friendship is a great relationship that blurs many distances and creates positive things. 
                     If any of us is lucky enough to have a good friend, we should try to keep that friendship for a long time.

                <h1>Love</h1>
                <p>
                    Everybody makes a few companions at various phases of life. 
                    A few companionships last more while some end in only a couple of months. 
                    The fundamental explanation for it is the presence of love. 
                    Indeed, even we ought to have a sentiment of affection for the needy and poor. 
                    They deserve our love the most. We should that is why show our love and affection to everybody irrespective of any differences among each other.

                <h1>Feature 1</h1>
                <p>The general scientific approach has three fundamental features (Stanovich, 2010). 1 The first is systematic empiricism. Empiricism refers to learning based on observation, and scientists learn about the natural world systematically, by carefully planning, making, recording, and analyzing observations of it. As we will see, logical reasoning and even creativity play important roles in science too, but scientists are unique in their insistence on checking their ideas about the way the world is against their systematic observations. Notice, for example, that Mehl and his colleagues did not trust other people’s stereotypes or even their own informal observations. Instead, they systematically recorded, counted, and compared the number of words spoken by a large sample of women and men. Furthermore, when their systematic observations turned out to conflict with people’s stereotypes, they trusted their systematic observations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature ft2">
                <h1>Feature 2</h1>
                <p>The second feature of the scientific approach—which follows in a straightforward way from the first—is that it is concerned with empirical questions. These are questions about the way the world actually is and, therefore, can be answered by systematically observing it. The question of whether women talk more than men is empirical in this way. Either women really do talk more than men or they do not, and this can be determined by systematically observing how much women and men actually talk. There are many interesting and important questions that are not empirically testable and that science cannot answer. Among them are questions about values—whether things are good or bad, just or unjust, or beautiful or ugly, and how the world oughtto be. So although the question of whether a stereotype is accurate or inaccurate is an empirically testable one that science can answer, the question of whether it is wrong for people to hold inaccurate stereotypes is not. Similarly, the question of whether criminal behavior has a genetic component is an empirical question, but the question of what should be done with people who commit crimes is not. It is especially important for researchers in psychology to be mindful of this distinction.</p>

            <div class="feature ft3">
                <h1>Feature 3</h1>
                <p>The third feature of science is that it creates public knowledge. After asking their empirical questions, making their systematic observations, and drawing their conclusions, scientists publish their work. This usually means writing an article for publication in a professional journal, in which they put their research question in the context of previous research, describe in detail the methods they used to answer their question, and clearly present their results and conclusions. Publication is an essential feature of science for two reasons. One is that science is a social process—a large-scale collaboration among many researchers distributed across both time and space. Our current scientific knowledge of most topics is based on many different studies conducted by many different researchers who have shared their work with each other over the years. The second is that publication allows science to be self-correcting. Individual scientists understand that despite their best efforts, their methods can be flawed and their conclusions incorrect. Publication allows others in the scientific community to detect and correct these errors so that, over time, scientific knowledge increasingly reflects the way the world actually is.</p>
